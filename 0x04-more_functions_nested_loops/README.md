# More on functions and nested loops.
This project is aimed at making students understand clearly how functions and nested
loops work.
## Technologies
* `gcc` compiler
* Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
* C89 coding standard for C
## Files
This section contain `10` mandatory tasks and `2` advanced tasks:
| Filename | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| `0-isupper.c` | Checks for uppercase characters. |
| `1-isdigit.c` | Checks for a digit (`0` through `9`). |
| `2-mul.c` | Multiplies two integers. |
| `3-print_numbers.c` |Prints the numbers, from `0` to `9`, followed by a new line.  |
| `4-print_most_numbers.c` | Prints the numbers, from `0` to `9` with exception of `2` and `4`, followed by a new line. |
| `5-more_numbers.c` | Prints 10 times the numbers, from `0` to `14`, followed by a new line. |
| `6-print_line` | Draws a straight line in the terminal. |
| `7-print_diagonal.c` | Draws a diagonal line on the terminal. |
| `8-print_square.c` |Prints a square, followed by a new line.  |
| `9-fizz_buzz.c` |Prints the numbers from `1` to `100`, followed by a new line. But for multiples of three print Fizz instead of the number and for the multiples of five print Buzz. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print FizzBuzz.  |
| `10-print_triangle.c` | Prints a triangle, followed by a new line. |
| `100-prime_factor.c` |Write a program that finds and prints the largest prime factor of the number `612852475143`, followed by a new line. |
| `101-print_number.c` |Prints an integer. |
| `main.h` | contain header files for the entire project |
